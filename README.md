# Personalized Federated Learning for Explainable and Privacy-Preserving Disease Risk Prediction in Heterogeneous Healthcare Systems

> **Research prototype, not a deployed medical tool.** This project simulates
> multiple hospitals by partitioning one public dataset (UCI Heart Disease,
> Cleveland) into non-IID splits. No real multi-hospital data or deployment
> is involved. Results are experimental and for academic/research purposes
> (PBL-3, Sharda University, Dept. of CSE (AI/ML), CSP-391).

## What this is

Hospitals cannot legally pool patient data, and a single global model trained
via standard Federated Learning (FedAvg) often underperforms for individual
hospitals whose patient populations differ (non-IID data). This project
studies whether combining **personalization (FedProx)** and
**explainability (SHAP)** on top of FedAvg improves both accuracy and
clinical interpretability, compared to FL alone, on simulated heterogeneous
hospital data.

Full problem framing, literature survey (48 papers), and proposal report are
in [`docs/proposal/`](docs/proposal/).

## Architecture

```
Layer 1 — Federated Learning: FedAvg via Flower across simulated hospital clients.
           Only model weight updates are transmitted — never raw patient data.
Layer 2 — Personalization: FedProx (proximal term) + local fine-tuning per hospital.
Layer 3 — Explainability: SHAP applied to every prediction (ranked feature contributions).
```

## Project status

Following the 8-phase roadmap in `docs/proposal/`:

- [x] Phase 1 — Literature survey, dataset & gap statement
- [x] **Phase 2 — Dataset preprocessing; non-IID hospital splits** (this commit)
- [ ] Phase 3 — Baseline: Local ML + Centralized ML
- [ ] Phase 4 — Federated Learning (FedAvg via Flower)
- [ ] Phase 5 — Personalization (FedProx) vs FedAvg comparison
- [ ] Phase 6 — SHAP explainability integration
- [ ] Phase 7 — FastAPI backend + React dashboard
- [ ] Phase 8 — Results compilation, research paper draft

## Dataset

UCI Heart Disease dataset, Cleveland processed subset (auto-downloaded to
`data/raw/` on first run). 303 patients, 14 clinical features
(age, sex, chest pain type, resting BP, cholesterol, etc.). The multi-class
severity target (0-4) is binarized to 0 = no disease, 1 = disease present,
following the standard convention for this dataset. 6 rows with missing
`ca`/`thal` values are dropped, leaving 297 patients.

## Non-IID hospital simulation strategy

We use **Dirichlet label-skew partitioning** (Hsu et al., 2019), the standard
non-IID simulation method in the federated learning literature, rather than
splitting on a single raw feature like age band. Each simulated hospital's
disease-prevalence rate is drawn from a `Dirichlet(alpha)` distribution per
class:

- **Low alpha (e.g. 0.1)** → highly skewed hospitals (some hospitals almost
  entirely healthy patients, others almost entirely diseased) — the
  low-alpha regime commonly used to stress-test personalized FL.
- **Moderate alpha (e.g. 0.5, our default)** → realistic heterogeneity: e.g.
  our 5-hospital split at alpha=0.5, seed=42 produces disease rates ranging
  from 0.0 to 1.0 across hospitals against a global rate of 0.46.
- **High alpha (e.g. 5.0)** → close to IID, used as a control/ablation.

This approach was chosen over a fixed feature-based split because it is (1)
the standard, citable method reviewers will recognize, (2) tunable via one
parameter (`alpha`) for ablation experiments without rewriting the splitting
logic, and (3) scales to any number of clients. See
[`src/data/partition.py`](src/data/partition.py) for the implementation and
[`experiments/phase2_partition_report.py`](experiments/phase2_partition_report.py)
for the reproducible report (summary table + chart, `experiments/results/`).

Caveat for the write-up: Dirichlet label-skew controls class *proportions*
per hospital, not hospital *size* — a given seed/alpha can produce
unevenly-sized hospitals (documented, not hidden, in the generated summary
table).

## Setup

```bash
python -m venv venv
venv\Scripts\pip install -r requirements.txt
```

> Note: on this development machine, `pandas>=3.0` failed to import due to a
> Windows Application Control policy blocking one of its DLLs. `pandas` is
> pinned to `2.2.3` in `requirements.txt`, which works correctly.

## Running Phase 2

```bash
venv\Scripts\python experiments\phase2_partition_report.py
```

Downloads the dataset (if needed), preprocesses it, builds 5 non-IID
hospital partitions, and writes a summary CSV + heterogeneity chart to
`experiments/results/`.
